          Search Engine Optimization In layman's terms, refers to the process of
          improving your website so that it appears more prominently when people
          search for products or services related to your business on Google,
          DuckDuckGo and other search engines.
          <br />
          The higher your pages appear in search results, the more likely you
          are to attract attention and attract new and existing customers to
